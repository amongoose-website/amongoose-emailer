# Mongoose Emailer

## Author: Joshua Grimmett

This is the service that takes email data and saves the attachments and body as a markdown file in [mongoose-gatsby-site](https://github.com/amongoose-website/mongoose-gatsby-site).

The process is a little hacky as the server pushes to the *mongoose-gatsby-site* git repo.

The service comes with an admin panel, accessible at https://emailer.amongoose.com. This is used to view and approve new blog posts as they come through as emails.4
